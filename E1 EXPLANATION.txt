It's a simple hospital management system that uses a priority queue to manage patients based on their priority.

```cpp
#include <iostream> 
#include <queue> 
#include <string> 
using namespace std;
```
These lines include the necessary libraries for the program. `iostream` is for input/output operations, `queue` is for using priority queue data structure, and `string` is for using string data type. `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

```cpp
struct Patient { 
    string name; 
    int priority; 
    Patient(const string& name, int priority) : name(name), priority(priority) {} 
    bool operator<(const Patient& other) const { 
        return priority > other.priority; 
    } 
};
```
This defines a structure `Patient` which represents a patient. Each patient has a name (`name`) and a priority (`priority`). The constructor initializes these values. The `<` operator is overloaded to compare patients based on their priority. Higher priority patients should come before lower priority ones in the priority queue.

```cpp
void displayMenu() { 
    cout << "Hospital Management System\n"; 
    cout << "1. Add Patient\n"; 
    cout << "2. Serve Patient\n"; 
    cout << "3. Display Patients\n"; 
    cout << "4. Exit\n"; 
}
```
This function displays the menu options to the user.

```cpp
int main() { 
    priority_queue<Patient> patients; 
    int choice; 
    do { 
        displayMenu(); 
        cout << "Enter your choice: "; 
        cin >> choice; 
        switch (choice) { 
            case 1: { 
                string name; 
                int priority; 
                cout << "Enter patient name: "; 
                cin >> name; 
                cout << "Enter patient priority: "; 
                cin >> priority; 
                patients.push(Patient(name, priority)); 
                cout << "Patient added successfully.\n"; 
                break; 
            }
            case 2: { 
                if (patients.empty()) { 
                    cout << "No patients to serve.\n"; 
                } else { 
                    cout << "Serving patient: " << patients.top().name << endl; 
                    patients.pop();
                }
                break; 
            }
            case 3: { 
                if (patients.empty()) { 
                    cout << "No patients in the queue.\n"; 
                } else { 
                    cout << "Patients in the queue:\n"; 
                    priority_queue<Patient> temp = patients; 
                    while (!temp.empty()) { 
                        cout << "Name: " << temp.top().name << ", Priority: " << temp.top().priority << endl; 
                        temp.pop(); 
                    } 
                }
                break; 
            }
            case 4: { 
                cout << "Exiting program.\n"; 
                break; 
            }
            default: { 
                cout << "Invalid choice. Please try again.\n"; 
                break; 
            } 
        } 
    } while (choice != 4); 
    return 0; 
}
```
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It creates a priority queue `patients` to store the patients. It then enters a loop where it displays the menu to the user and performs the chosen operation. The operations include adding a patient (option 1), serving a patient (option 2), displaying the patients in the queue (option 3), and exiting the program (option 4). If the user enters an invalid option, it displays an error message. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit. The `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
