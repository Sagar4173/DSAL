```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
```
These lines include the necessary header files for input/output operations (`iostream`), the priority queue data structure (`queue`), and string manipulation (`string`).

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
This line allows the program to use names from the `std` namespace without having to write `std::` before each name.

```cpp
struct Patient {
    string name;
    int priority; // Priority of the patient, lower value means higher priority

    // Constructor
    Patient(const string& name, int priority) : name(name), priority(priority) {}

    // Overloading the < operator to compare patients based on priority
    bool operator<(const Patient& other) const {
        // Higher priority patients should come before lower priority ones
        return priority > other.priority;
    }
};
```
This defines a structure `Patient` that represents a patient. It has two member variables: `name` (a string) and `priority` (an integer). The lower the value of `priority`, the higher the priority of the patient. The structure also has a constructor that initializes the `name` and `priority` members, and an overloaded `<` operator that defines how patients are compared based on their priority (for use in the priority queue).

```cpp
void displayMenu() {
    cout << "Hospital Management System\n";
    cout << "1. Add Patient\n";
    cout << "2. Serve Patient\n";
    cout << "3. Display Patients\n";
    cout << "4. Exit\n";
}
```
This function `displayMenu()` simply prints the menu options to the console.

```cpp
int main() {
    priority_queue<Patient> patients; // Priority queue to store patients
    int choice;
    // ...
}
```
This is the `main()` function where the program execution starts. It declares a `priority_queue` of `Patient` objects named `patients` to store the patients based on their priority. It also declares an integer variable `choice` to store the user's menu choice.

```cpp
do {
    displayMenu();
    cout << "Enter your choice: ";
    cin >> choice;
    switch (choice) {
        // ...
    }
} while (choice != 4);
```
This is a `do-while` loop that continues until the user chooses option 4 (Exit). Inside the loop, the `displayMenu()` function is called to display the menu options, and the user's choice is read into the `choice` variable. Then, a `switch` statement is used to execute the appropriate code based on the user's choice.

```cpp
case 1: {
    string name;
    int priority;
    cout << "Enter patient name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Enter patient priority: ";
    cin >> priority;
    patients.push(Patient(name, priority));
    cout << "Patient added successfully.\n";
    break;
}
```
If the user chooses option 1 (Add Patient), the program prompts the user to enter the patient's name and priority. It then creates a new `Patient` object with the provided name and priority, and adds it to the `patients` priority queue using the `push()` method.

```cpp
case 2: {
    if (patients.empty()) {
        cout << "No patients to serve.\n";
    } else {
        cout << "Serving patient: " << patients.top().name << endl;
        patients.pop();
    }
    break;
}
```
If the user chooses option 2 (Serve Patient), the program checks if the `patients` priority queue is empty. If it's not empty, it prints the name of the patient at the front of the queue (the one with the highest priority) using the `top()` method, and then removes that patient from the queue using the `pop()` method.

```cpp
case 3: {
    if (patients.empty()) {
        cout << "No patients in the queue.\n";
    } else {
        cout << "Patients in the queue:\n";
        priority_queue<Patient> temp = patients; // Create a copy of the priority queue
        while (!temp.empty()) {
            cout << "Name: " << temp.top().name << ", Priority: " << temp.top().priority << endl;
            temp.pop();
        }
    }
    break;
}
```
If the user chooses option 3 (Display Patients), the program checks if the `patients` priority queue is empty. If it's not empty, it creates a temporary copy of the priority queue (`temp`) and iterates over it using a `while` loop. For each patient in the queue, it prints the patient's name and priority. The `temp` queue is used to avoid modifying the original `patients` queue.

```cpp
case 4: {
    cout << "Exiting program.\n";
    break;
}
default: {
    cout << "Invalid choice. Please try again.\n";
    break;
}
```
If the user chooses option 4 (Exit), the program prints a message indicating that it's exiting. If the user enters an invalid choice, the `default` case is executed, which prints an error message.

Overall, this program implements a hospital management system using a priority queue data structure. It allows users to add patients with a priority, serve the patient with the highest priority, and display the list of patients in the queue sorted by priority.
