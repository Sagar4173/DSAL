Sure, let's go through the program line by line and explain it in simple language:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
```
This line includes all the standard C++ header files, which is not a recommended practice, but it's often used for convenience in competitive programming.

```cpp
#define max 20
```
This line defines a preprocessor macro `max` with a value of 20, which represents the maximum number of employee records that can be stored.

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
This line allows the program to use names from the `std` namespace without having to write `std::` before each name.

```cpp
struct employee {
    string name;
    long int code;
    string designation;
    int exp;
    int age;
};
```
This defines a structure `employee` that represents an employee record. It has five member variables: `name` (a string for the employee's name), `code` (a long integer for the employee's ID), `designation` (a string for the employee's designation), `exp` (an integer for the employee's experience), and `age` (an integer for the employee's age).

```cpp
int num;
void showMenu();
employee emp[max], tempemp[max], sortemp[max], sortemp1[max];
```
- `num` is an integer variable to store the current number of employee records.
- `showMenu()` is a function declaration for displaying the menu options.
- `emp`, `tempemp`, `sortemp`, and `sortemp1` are arrays of `employee` structures to store employee records.

```cpp
void insert() {
    // ...
}
```
This is a function `insert()` that allows the user to add a new employee record.

Inside the function:
1. It checks if the current number of employee records (`num`) is less than the maximum allowed (`max`).
2. If there is space available, it prompts the user to enter the information for the new employee (name, ID, designation, experience, and age).
3. The new employee record is stored in the `emp` array at the current index (`num`).
4. The `num` variable is incremented to reflect the addition of a new record.
5. If the employee size is full, it displays a message "Employee Size Full".
6. Finally, it calls the `showMenu()` function to display the menu options.

```cpp
void deleteIndex(int i) {
    // ...
}
```
This is a helper function `deleteIndex()` that removes the employee record at a given index `i` by shifting all the subsequent records up by one position.

Inside the function:
1. It uses a `for` loop to iterate from the given index `i` to `num - 2`.
2. For each index `j`, it copies the values of the next record (`emp[j + 1]`) to the current record (`emp[j]`), effectively shifting the records up by one position.

```cpp
void deleteRecord() {
    // ...
}
```
This is a function `deleteRecord()` that allows the user to delete an employee record by providing the employee ID.

Inside the function:
1. It prompts the user to enter the employee ID to delete.
2. It uses a `for` loop to iterate through all the employee records in the `emp` array.
3. If the current employee's ID matches the entered ID, it calls the `deleteIndex()` function with the current index `i` to remove that record.
4. The `num` variable is decremented to reflect the removal of a record.
5. If no matching record is found, it simply returns without deleting anything.
6. Finally, it calls the `showMenu()` function to display the menu options.

```cpp
void searchRecord() {
    // ...
}
```
This is a function `searchRecord()` that allows the user to search for an employee record by providing the employee ID.

Inside the function:
1. It prompts the user to enter the employee ID to search.
2. It uses a `for` loop to iterate through all the employee records in the `emp` array.
3. If the current employee's ID matches the entered ID, it displays the employee's information (name, ID, designation, experience, and age).
4. If no matching record is found, it simply returns without displaying anything.
5. Finally, it calls the `showMenu()` function to display the menu options.

```cpp
void showMenu() {
    // ...
}
```
This is the `showMenu()` function that displays the menu options and handles user input.

Inside the function:
1. It displays a menu with the following options:
   - Insert New Entry (1)
   - Delete Entry (2)
   - Search a Record (3)
   - Exit (4)
2. It prompts the user to enter their choice.
3. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function:
   - If the choice is 1, it calls the `insert()` function to add a new employee record.
   - If the choice is 2, it calls the `deleteRecord()` function to delete an employee record.
   - If the choice is 3, it calls the `searchRecord()` function to search for an employee record.
   - If the choice is 4, it returns from the function (effectively exiting the program).
   - If the choice is invalid, it displays an error message and calls `showMenu()` again.

```cpp
int main() {
    showMenu();
    return 0;
}
```
This is the `main()` function where the program execution starts.

Inside the `main()` function:
1. It calls the `showMenu()` function to display the menu options and handle user input.
2. The program terminates with a return value of 0.

Overall, this program implements a simple employee management system. It allows the user to add new employee records, delete existing employee records by providing the employee ID, and search for employee records by providing the employee ID. The program uses an array of `employee` structures to store the employee records and provides a menu-driven interface for performing various operations.
