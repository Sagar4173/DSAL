It's a simple dictionary program that uses a binary search tree (BST) data structure for storing and retrieving words (keywords) and their meanings.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string.h>
using namespace std;
```
These lines include the necessary libraries for the program. `iostream` is for input/output operations, and `string.h` is for string manipulation functions. `using namespace std;` allows us to use standard library functions without prefixing them with `std::`.

```cpp
struct node
{
    char k[20];
    char m[20];
    class node *left;
    class node * right;
};
```
This defines a structure `node` which represents a node in the BST. Each node has a keyword (`k`), a meaning (`m`), and pointers to its left and right children (`left` and `right`).

```cpp
class dict
{
public:
    node *root;
    void create();
    void disp(node *);
    void insert(node * root,node *temp);
    int search(node *,char []);
    int update(node *,char []);
    node* del(node *,char []);
    node * min(node *);
};
```
This defines a class `dict` which represents the dictionary. It has a root node (`root`) and several methods for creating the dictionary (`create`), displaying its contents (`disp`), inserting a new node (`insert`), searching for a keyword (`search`), updating the meaning of a keyword (`update`), deleting a keyword (`del`), and finding the node with the minimum keyword value (`min`).

The `create` method prompts the user to enter keywords and their meanings, and inserts them into the BST. The `insert` method inserts a new node into the BST at the correct position based on the keyword value. The `disp` method displays all the keywords and their meanings in the BST in order. The `search` method searches for a keyword in the BST and returns 1 if found, 0 otherwise. The `update` method updates the meaning of a keyword in the BST. The `del` method deletes a keyword from the BST. The `min` method finds the node with the minimum keyword value in the BST.

```cpp
int main()
{
    int ch,loop=1;
    dict d;
    d.root = NULL;
    while(loop==1)
    {
        cout<<"\n-----Menu-----"<<"\n1.Create\n2.Display\n3.Search\n4.Update\n5.Delete\n6.Exit\nEnter Your Choice : ";
        cin>>ch;
        switch(ch)
        {
            case 1:
                d.create();
                break;
            case 2:
                if(d.root == NULL)
                {
                    cout<<"\nDictionary is Empty";
                }
                else
                {
                    cout<<"Keyword \t Meaning\n";
                    cout<<"----------------------";
                    d.disp(d.root);
                }
                break;
            case 3:
                if(d.root == NULL)

                    char k[20];
                    cin>>k;
                    int f=d.search(d.root,k);
                    if( f == 1)
                        cout<<"\nKeyword Found";
                    else
                        cout<<"\nKeyword Not Found";
                }
                break;
            case 4:
                if(d.root == NULL)
                {
                    cout<<"\nDictionary is Empty";
                }
                else
                {

                    char k[20];
                    cin>>k;
                    if(d.update(d.root,k) == 1)
                        cout<<"\nMeaning Updated";
                    else
                        cout<<"\nKeyword Not Found";
                }
                break;
            case 5:
                if(d.root == NULL)
                {
                    cout<<"\nDictionary is Empty";
                }
                else
                {
                    cout<<"\nEnter Keyword which u want to delete :: ";
                    char k[20];
                    cin>>k;
                    if(d.root == NULL)
                    {
                        cout<<"\nKeyword Not Found";
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        d.root = d.del(d.root,k);
                    }
                }
                break;
            case 6:
                loop=0;
                cout<<"Thank You!";
                break;
            default:
                cout<<"You entered something wrong";
                break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It creates a `dict` object `d` and displays a menu to the user. Depending on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate method of `d`. The menu keeps looping until the user chooses to exit (option 6). If the user enters an invalid option, it displays an error message. The `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
